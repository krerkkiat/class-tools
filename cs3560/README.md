Tools are not really produced in this class, but there is Git command instead.

## Git
`git log --graph --all --decorate` is inspired by (and taken from) this video [Linux.conf.au 2013 - Git For Ages 4 And Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffBJ4sVUb4). This can be configured as alias in Git as

```
[alias]
	flog = log --graph --all --decorate
	lgo = log --graph --all --decorate --oneline
```
