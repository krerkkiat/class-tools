# mkhtml
This is the Python clone for the p1p2_mkhtml (or labs_mkhtml) script
that Mr. John Dolan, EECS instructor at Ohio University has for his
class CS 2401.

It also have to simple server and some configuration files, so it can be
deployed to the Heroku for public access as well.

## Excerpt from comment
This will allow student to use their own machince to turn
the output of the project 4 program into a HTML file.

This might reduce the time to transfer the output file
from local machince to the Prime server (and other way
arond to get the HTML file back).

Although this module is part of the mkhtml_server, a flask
web application, it can be called from command line with both
Python2 or Python3 to locally parse the output file.
